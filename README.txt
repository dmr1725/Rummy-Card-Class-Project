Rules of play: you can do a set with 3 or more cards. If a set contains 3 cards and you have the last card to complete the set, you can lay that card to the set.

NOTE: 
	I can run the jar file on the command line with this command: "java -jar C:\Users\diego\Documents\CardGameDiego4\out\artifacts\CardGameDiego_jar\CardGameDiego.jar".
	I assume you can do the same, but use the absolute path based on your computer. The program runs fine. The only detail is that it does not show the card on the top
	of the stack, neither the face down card on the deck. However, that didn't happened when the program was running in the IDE. 

SECOND NOTE: Design Document
	My code is reflected by the design document. There were very minor changes.
